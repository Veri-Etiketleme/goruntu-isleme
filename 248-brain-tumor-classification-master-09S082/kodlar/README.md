Brain Tumor Classification 

In this project, we do Brain Tumor Classification using deep learning techniques. <br />
We first do segmentation with state of the art deep learning models, we used the winner architecture of BRATS 2018 competition. <br />
Then we do Classification using transfer learning, we used architectures like VGG16, VGG19, Resnet50 etc, and achieved a final accuracy of 92.54%. <br />
