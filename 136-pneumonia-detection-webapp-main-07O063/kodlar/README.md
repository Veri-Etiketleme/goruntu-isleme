Chest X-rays are primarily used for the of pneumonia disease. However, even for a trained radiologist, it is challenging task to examine chest X-rays. There is also a need to improve the diagnosis accuracy.

Detection of pneumonia using Machine learning is deep learning approach for faster detection of pneumonia from X ray scans. Developed an efficient model for the detection of pneumonia trained on chest X-ray images, which could aid the radiologist in their decision making process. Because in health sector accurate and faster diagnosis means everything.
