# Mask Detector

Mask detection solution using a 2-step process of performing face detection first and then detecting if the person wears a face mask.

Trained on 2000 images crawled from Google/Bing/Flickr image search using a [**web image crawler**](https://gitlab.com/unfixable/web-image-crawler) from another personal project of mine.

Training has been done for 30 epochs and the result can be observed in the video below:
