# Image Classification-Segmentation

This is my final assignment for the Neural Networks course. This project's goal was to prepare the data mostly with numpy and build a Neural Network with Tensorflow/Keras to classify images and then using most of the first neural net for segmentation using Transfer Learning.

The course contained a lot of theory but we still had to create something using the theory via the assignments.
